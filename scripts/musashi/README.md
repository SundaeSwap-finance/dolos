# Musashi Leios devnet sync operations

These run on the box that syncs Dolos from origin against the Musashi Leios devnet, from `/opt/build/run`, where they must stay byte identical to these copies.

`checkpoint.sh` stops the `dolos-sync` container, copies its data directory to `checkpoints/<store tip slot>`, starts it again and logs the tip, the size and how long the sync was down, and `dolos-checkpoint.timer` runs it with `--if-crossed` every five minutes so it acts only once the applied tip has crossed another ten percent of the chain, keeping the newest four and skipping when under 15 GB would remain free.

`rewind.sh <tip-slot>` puts one of those checkpoints back, keeping the store it replaced as `data.broken.<timestamp>`, and it copies rather than moves so the same checkpoint can be used twice.

`status.py` reports progress as three separately labelled slots, because the pull stage's slot, the apply stage's lower bound and the store's own tip are different numbers and reading one as another has misled a diagnosis.

`compare-utxo-set.py` takes no arguments, reads the node's whole utxo set through `guarded-utxo.sh`, which kills a dump that would press the box, and asks the follower for every one of those keys over UtxoRPC in batches, and prints one `UTXO` count line, a line per missing or differing key, and exits non-zero if anything differs or if the follower never came level. Set `EXTRA_KEYS` to a file of `txid#index` lines to also check the other direction, which no enumeration of the follower can reach.

`compare-params.py` takes no arguments, reads the node's protocol parameters with `cardano-cli` and the follower's over UtxoRPC, and prints one line per parameter ending IDENTICAL, DIFFERS or REPORTED, a `PARAMS` count line, and exits non-zero if anything differs.

`probe/run-probe.sh` takes no arguments and talks to no node, and runs both comparisons six times over fixtures, once over a ledger that agrees and once each over a ledger with a known parameter fault, a known utxo fault, a reply that names a key without the utxo under it and a follower holding a utxo the node does not, checking both the exit and the line each one prints, and its expected last line is `PROBE 6 arms, 6 as expected`.

`ignored-inventory.py <cargo test log>` names every test binary in that log which passes no test, either because it ignores all of them or because it holds none, and refuses one that `test_data/all-ignored-binaries.toml` does not record with a reason, a recorded entry that now passes a test, a log naming no binary, a log holding a failure, and a log naming one target twice. Its count line reads `INVENTORY <n> binaries, <a> all ignored, <e> empty, <u> unrecorded, <s> stale`. Run it on the log of a whole workspace test run, because a summed count line over 65 binaries hides the ones whose green asserted nothing.

`probe/run-inventory-probe.sh` takes an optional tree root and runs that check over six logs under `test_data/inventory-arms`, one it must accept and five it must refuse, and its expected last line is `INVENTORY PROBE 6 arms, 6 as expected`. `tests/musashi_harness_arms.rs` runs it and `probe/run-probe.sh` under `cargo test`, so a harness that stopped refusing fails the suite.
