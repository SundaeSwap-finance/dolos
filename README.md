## What is Dolos?

Cardano nodes traditionally assume one of two roles: block producer or relay. Dolos introduces a third role: the **data node** — optimized for keeping an updated ledger and responding to queries while requiring a fraction of the resources.

Dolos connects directly to the Cardano network using Ouroboros Node-to-Node (N2N) mini-protocols (via [Pallas](https://github.com/txpipe/pallas)). It relies on honest upstream peers rather than performing full consensus validation, enabling significant resource savings.

## The Leios and Dijkstra track

This branch of the fork at github.com/geofflittle/dolos follows the Leios
Musashi testnet, which runs at network magic 164. Its base is upstream commit
ce3d042. Upstream Dolos cannot follow that testnet: its blocks are Dijkstra
era, and a ranking block there carries no transactions of its own but certifies
a Leios endorser block that does.

What this branch adds on top of upstream. None of it is posted upstream yet.

- Dijkstra era blocks decoded and applied to the ledger, with the certificates,
  treasury donations and epoch boundary rules that era changed.
- The Leios endorsement layer followed from the pull stage, so a certified
  endorser block is fetched and its transactions applied under the ranking
  block that certified it.
- Dijkstra protocol parameters answered over the Ouroboros query service,
  including the PlutusV4 cost model.
- Scripts that sync, checkpoint and rewind a Musashi devnet, and one that
  compares the follower to a node.

It needs a pallas that decodes the Dijkstra era and speaks the Leios fetch mini
protocol, which upstream pallas does not. The workspace takes pallas from the
branch `leios-musashi` of github.com/geofflittle/pallas, by commit:

```toml
[workspace.dependencies]
pallas = { git = "https://github.com/geofflittle/pallas", rev = "3c595fbdc4ad3c2cbc897b92ef880f1553d4cd61", features = ["hardano", "phase2", "unstable", "network2"] }
```

Cargo reads the features from the dependency entry. A `features` key written
inside a `[patch.crates-io]` entry is accepted and then dropped, and cargo says
so in a warning. The `network2` feature gates the Leios fetch protocol in
pallas, so a build that omits it cannot fetch an endorser block.

Branches on this fork may be rewritten at any time. A published tag is never
moved and never deleted, and the commit it names stays reachable. Consumers pin
a tag or a commit, never a branch.

Build it as upstream Dolos is built, with a rust toolchain matching
`rust-toolchain.toml`:

```sh
cargo build --release
cargo test --workspace
```

## Why Dolos?

- **Low resource footprint** — Runs with a small fraction of the memory and CPU required by a traditional Cardano node
- **Rich API surface** — Multiple protocols to match your existing stack: REST, gRPC, HTTP, JSON-RPC, and Ouroboros
- **Flexible storage mode** — Choose your data retention: ledger-only, sliding window, or full archive
- **Full multi-era support** — Handles all Cardano eras from Byron through Conway, including full governance support (DReps, proposals, voting)

## Flexibility

**Choose your storage profile:**

| Profile | Description | Best For |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Ledger-only** | Current state only (UTxO set, pools, protocol params) — minimal disk | Services needing only current ledger state |
| **Sliding history** | Configurable retention window for recent data | Most dApps that need recent history |
| **Full archive** | Complete chain history from genesis | Explorers, analytics, archival |

**Choose your API surface:**

| API | Protocol | Best For |
|-----|----------|----------|
| **MiniBF** | REST (Blockfrost-compatible) | Existing Blockfrost integrations, wallets, SDKs |
| **MiniKupo** | HTTP (Kupo-compatible) | Pattern-based UTxO matching, chain indexing |
| **UTxO RPC** | gRPC / gRPC-Web | High-performance streaming, browser clients |
| **TRP** | JSON-RPC (Tx3) | Transaction building with Tx3 framework |
| **Ouroboros** | Node-to-Client | cardano-cli compatibility, Ogmios workflows |

## Features

### Data Capabilities

- **Full historical reward logs** — Complete reward distribution calculations and epoch state management
- **Stake distribution snapshots** — Historical stake snapshots and epoch boundary logic
- **Pool registry & metadata** — Pool registration, retirement handling, and delegator tracking
- **Asset registry** — Token and NFT metadata tracking with CIP-25 support
- **Script indexing** — Support of search / retrieval of scripts / datums by hash
- **Governance data** — DRep registration, proposals, and voting state (Conway era)

### Developer Experience

- **Mempool-aware transaction submit** — Tracks pending, inflight, and finalized UTxO states, enabling transaction chaining workflows
- **Local devnet mode** — Ephemeral single-node network via for offline development
- **Fast Mithril bootstrap** — Sync mainnet from Mithril snapshot in under 20 hours
- **Dolos snapshots** — Export and load node state in minutes for rapid deployment
- **Multi-platform binaries** — Native packages for macOS (Apple Silicon), Linux (ARM64/x64), Windows x64, plus Docker images

### Operations & Observability

- **Purpose-built storage** — Fjall LSM trees for state and archive data, with a Redb WAL for crash recovery
- **OpenTelemetry integration** — Distributed tracing with OTLP export
- **Prometheus metrics** — Health and performance monitoring endpoints
- **Rust implementation** — Memory safety, high performance, and small binary size

## Architecture

Dolos follows a modular, layered architecture:

- **Core abstractions** (`dolos-core`) — Storage traits (State, Archive, WAL), entity-delta system, and batch processing pipeline
- **Cardano logic** (`dolos-cardano`) — Era-specific block processing, validation, reward calculation, and UTxO delta computation
- **Storage backends** — Fjall state/archive stores, a Redb WAL, and builtin in-memory stores for ephemeral nodes and tests
- **Service layer** — gRPC, REST, and Ouroboros protocol servers

Data is organized into three storage layers: State (current ledger and live-UTxO tags), Archive (historical blocks and their lookup indexes), and WAL (crash recovery). State mutations use an entity-delta pattern enabling efficient rollbacks without full snapshots.
