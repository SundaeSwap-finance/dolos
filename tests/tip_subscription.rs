//! What a tip subscription delivers, taken against the real `DomainAdapter`.
//!
//! A caller subscribes from the last point it applied, so that point must not
//! come back: applying it twice applies its transactions twice. The test
//! double in `dolos-testing` already excludes it, so only a subscription taken
//! against the adapter the node runs can say whether the node does.
